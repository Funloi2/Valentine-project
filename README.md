# 💖 Valentine's Surprise

A simple, interactive Java application built with JavaFX to ask a very important question!

## 🚀 About the Project
This project is a playful "Valentine's" game. It features:
* **Interactive UI:** A persistent "Yes" button and a mischievous "No" button.
* **Dynamic Animations:** The "No" button jumps to random positions when approached by the mouse, while the "Yes" button grows larger with every attempt to click "No."
* **Celebratory Reveals:** Includes a cycling series of "No" GIFs and a final success animation when the "Yes" button is selected.
